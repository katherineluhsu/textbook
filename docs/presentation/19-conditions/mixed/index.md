# Mixed Conditions

A condition may be composed of different types of protases and apodoses or, sometimes, even entire other grammatical constructions like [hortatory subjunctives](../../18-orders/independent-subjunctive/#hortatory-subjunctive/) or [imperatives](../../18-orders/imperative/). In such cases, analyze each half of the condition on its own terms and translate accordingly before putting the two halves together. For example:

- *sī haec verba dīxisset, laetus essem.*

The protasis of this mixed condition uses a pluperfect subjunctive verb: that makes it the protasis of a past contrary-to-fact, translated as "had [verb]ed."  

- If he had said these words, *laetus essem.*

The apodosis, on the other hand, uses an *imperfect* subjunctive verb: that makes it the apodosis of a present contrary-to-fact, translated as "would [verb]." When we put the two halves together, we come up with the following translation:

- If he had said these words, I would be happy.

You can also use other grammatical structures in place of an apodosis, such as a command:

- *sī hoc dīcat, domum eāmus.* If he should say this, let us go home. (hortatory subjunctive)
  - Note that because *eāmus* is present subjunctive, we can also interpret this as a straightforward future less vivid condition: "If he should say this, we would go home." Context is key when you're making this determination.
- *sī legēs mutāre velīs, epistulam scrībe!* If you should want to change the laws, write a letter! (imperative mood verb)

Note also that [ablative absolutes](../../10-participles/ablative-absolute/) can also be translated as conditionals, if such a translation makes sense in the context of the narrative:

- *hostibus ā mīlitibus nostrīs victīs, incolumēs fuissēmus.* If the enemies had been conquered by our soldiers, we would have been safe. (ablative absolute replacing the protasis of a past contrary-to-fact)
