# Indirect Statement

In English, there are two ways to report what someone says. We can report it **directly** by using quotations or we can report it **indirectly** by paraphrasing it. Consider the following examples:

- Direct Statement: The students said: "We like Latin."
- Indirect Statement: The students said **that** they like Latin.
- Direct Statement: She said: "Pizza is the best food."
- Indirect Statement: She said **that** pizza is the best food.

How do we differentiate between what someone actually said and a paraphrase of what they said in Latin? The answer is that we change the form that we use for the subject and main verb of the statement. When we replicate what was actually said, we follow the nominative subject and finite verb pattern that we have already met this semester:

- Dixit: “pater amavit filias.”
- He said: "The father loved his daughters."

To indicate that we are paraphrasing what the speaker said, we use the **accusative** to represent the **subject** of the indirect statement and an **infinitive** as the **verbal action** of the indirect statement.

- Dixit patrem amāre filiās.
- He said **that** the father loved his daughters.

Thus, we can recognize **indirect statement** by the use of an **accusative subject** and an **infinitive** following the sentence's main verb. (Be sure to review [infinitive formation](../04-verbal-nouns-and-adjectives/infinitives/).)

While the main verb in these constructions is often a verb of speaking (e.g. *dicō, dicere, dixī, dictus*, "to say, speak"), indirect statements in Latin can also be introduced by what is known as a **verb of the head**, a verb for any action you can do with your head (e.g., speaking, thinking, learning, perceiving, believing, seeing, agreeing).

Here are some examples of indirect statements with different examples of verbs of the head (bolded):

- **Credēbat** patrem amāre filiās. ("**He was believing** that the father loved his daughters.")
- **Vīdit** patrem amāre filiās. ("**He saw** that the father loved his daughters.")
- **Didicit** patrem amāre filiās. ("**He learned** that the father loved his daughters.")
- **Cognovit** patrem amāre filiās. ("**He knew** that the father loved his daughters.")

In all of these sentences, notice that we have an accusative direct object in addition to the accusative subject and infinitive as the verb. Because we can't necessarily use Latin word order to determine meaning, you may have to use context clues to determine which accusative is the subject and which accusative is the direct object.

For example, in the last sentence (*cognovit patrem amāre fīliās*), if the context calls for it, it would be just as correct to translate the sentence as "He knew that **the daughters** loved **their father**."

# Time in Indirect statement

Time in indirect statement is relative to the main verb. What that means is that the tense of the infinitive tells us when the action of the indirect statement happened *in relation to* the time of the main verb. For instance, the use of a **present infinitive** tells us that the action of the infinitive of the indirect statement happens *at the same time* as the action of the main verb (e.g., thinking/speaking/seeing). So, that means that if, for example, the main verb is in a past tense, then the action of the present infinitive should be translated in the past tense too, despite the fact that it's a "present" infinitive. Note the following examples:

- *Credit* patrem *amāre* filiās. ("He *believes* that the father *loves* his daughter.")
- *Credidit* patrem *amāre* filiās. ("He *believed* that the father *loved* his daughters.")
- *Credit* filiās *amāri* ab patre. ("He *believes* that the daughters *are loved* by their father.")
- *Credidit* filiās *amāri* ab patre. ("He *believed* that the daughters *were loved* by their father.")

The [**perfect infinitive**](../04-verbal-nouns-and-adjectives/infinitives/#perfect-active-infinitive) is used to indicate that the action of the infinitive happened *before* the action of the main verb:

- *Credit* patrem *amāvisse* filiās. ("He *believes* that the father *loved* his daughter.")
- *Credidit* patrem *amāvisse* filiās. ("He *believed* that the father *had loved* his daughters.")
  - Note that the translation "had loved" is technically the **pluperfect tense**, which indicates an action that happened *before* an action in the past.

- *Credit* filiās *amātās esse* ab patre. ("He *believes* that the daughters *were loved* by their father.")
- *Credidit* filiās *amātās esse* ab patre. ("He *believed* that the daughters *had been loved* by their father.")
  - Note again that "had been loved" is in the pluperfect tense to indicate an action that took place *before* a past tense action.

The **future infinitive** (no need to worry to much about this for now) is used to indicate that the action of the indirect statement infinitive happened *after* the action of the main verb:

- *Credit* patrem *amāturum esse* filiās. ("He *believes* that the father *will love* his daughters.")
